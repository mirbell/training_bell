##Libraries and data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate) # for bonus question

# Quick question: Do you get a message after loading the libraries? What is it telling you? Talk to your neighbor about it or write a note in your qmd.

# Yes, there is a message because we didn't indicate "false" at start up. It is telling us about the package lubridate that has been loaded. 
```
```{r}

bird<- X52_pp52_birds_1
survey<-X52_pp52_surveys_1
taxa<-X52_pp52_taxalist_1
sites<-X52_pp52_sites_1
